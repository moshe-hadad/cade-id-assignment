# Project Title

Event to case correlation (case id assignment) in network traffic data

## Description

This project is part of the Data Science Lab course in University of Haifa.  
The aim of this project is to present a method for assigning a process instance case id to specific packets in 
network traffic data which feature multiple process instance executions.  
The method steps are:  
1) Identify case id attributes on the training data
2) Collect and cluster attributes values from the network data (interleaved data) and addign each group with a number 
as a case id
3) Assign a case id number to packets containing the suitable values from the group
